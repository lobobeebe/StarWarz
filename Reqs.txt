Components:
Player Body
* Shall be an Invisible game object representing the body
* Shall act as the hit box for the player's torso
* Shall maintain the same X,Z position and y rotation as SteamVR headset
* Shall hold a Lightsaber "Holster" or clip on front of object

Player Hands
* Shall provide an anchor transform for a held Lightsaber Hilt
* Shall contain a Force Gesture Recognition Module. (See below)
* Shall maintain a Lightsaber Held state: Holding or Not Holding.
* Shall maintain a Force Selection state: None, Push, Grab, Lightning, Heal, or Future.
* When in the Not Holding state, the "Grip" button is pressed, and the hand is colliding with a Lightsaber Hilt, the Hand shall become the Lightsaber Hilt's anchor point.
* When in the Holding state, the "Grip" button is pressed, and the hand is colliding with a Holster, the Holster shall become the Lightsaber Hilt's anchor point.
* When in the Not Holding state, the "Grip" button is pressed, and the hand is not colliding with a Lightsaber Hilt, the Hand shall begin forwarding it's position to the Force Gesture Recognition Module every nth FixedUpdate, where n is a configurable value.
* The Hand shall cease forwarding it's position to the Force Gesture Recognition Module when the "Grip" button is released. The Force Selection state shall be updated to the Force Gesture Recognition Module's selection.

Force Gesture Recognition Module:
* TBA

Holster
* Shall provide an anchor transform for an unheld Lightsaber Hilt

Laser Bolt
* Moves in its transform's forward direction
* After spawning, a 5 second timer is started. If the timer completes, the game object is destroyed.
* If the Laser Bolt touches the Lightsaber, the Laser Bolt's forward vector is set to the normalized vector of the vector addition of the Laser Bolt's backward vector and the velocity of the Lightsaber. The timer is reset.
